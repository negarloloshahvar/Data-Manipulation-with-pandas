# Data-Manipulation-with-pandas

## Course Description
In this course, I'll practice how to manipulate DataFrames, as I extract, filter, and transform real-world datasets for analysis. Using pandas I’ll explore all the core data science concepts. Using real-world data, including Walmart sales figures and global temperature time series, I’ll learn how to import, clean, calculate statistics, and create visualizations.
