# Data-Manipulation-with-pandas

## Course Description
In this course, I'll practice how to manipulate DataFrames, as I extract, filter, and transform real-world datasets for analysis. Using pandas I’ll explore all the core data science concepts. Using real-world data, including Walmart sales figures and global temperature time series, I’ll learn how to import, clean, calculate statistics, and create visualizations.

### Chapter 1
.head() returns the first few rows (the “head” of the DataFrame).
.info() shows information on each of the columns, such as the data type and number of missing values.
.shape returns the number of rows and columns of the DataFrame.
.describe() calculates a few summary statistics for each column.
